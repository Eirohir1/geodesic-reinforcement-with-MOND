=== TULLY-FISHER ANALYSIS ===
Comparing your geodesic reinforcement theory to established scaling laws...
Analyzing 156 successful galaxies...

🔬 TULLY-FISHER RELATION:
   Your theory predicts: M_baryonic ∝ V_flat^3.53
   Observed typically: M_baryonic ∝ V_flat^3.5
   Correlation: r = 0.939

🔬 GEODESIC SCALE vs GALAXY SIZE:
   ell ∝ R_galaxy^0.72
   Correlation: r = 0.637

🔬 COUPLING STRENGTH vs MASS:
   α = -0.105 * log(M) + 0.644
   Correlation: r = -0.715

🎯 SUMMARY:
✅ Your theory reproduces galaxy scaling laws!
✅ Geodesic scale correlates with galaxy size (r=0.637)
✅ Parameters have physical meaning
📊 Median ell/R_galaxy ratio: 0.65
