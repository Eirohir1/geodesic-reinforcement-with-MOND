üî¨ FUNDAMENTAL SCALING RELATIONS DISCOVERED:
1. TULLY-FISHER LAW:
   M_baryonic ‚àù V_flat^3.53 ¬± 0.10
   r = 0.939, p = 2.27e-73
   (Standard: M ‚àù V^3.5)

2. GEODESIC SCALE LAW (NEW):
   ell ‚àù R_galaxy^0.72 ¬± 0.08
   r = 0.604, p = 7.32e-17

3. MASS-COUPLING LAW (NEW):
   Œ± = (-0.105 ¬± 0.008) √ó log(M) + 0.644
   r = -0.715, p = 1.09e-25

4. GEOMETRIC COUPLING RELATION:
   (ell/R_galaxy) vs Œ±: r = 0.128

üß† PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
‚Ä¢ Geodesic reinforcement naturally explains galaxy dynamics
‚Ä¢ Spacetime curvature effects scale with galaxy properties
‚Ä¢ Dark matter behavior emerges from geometry
‚Ä¢ No exotic particles needed!
